# To-Do-app: Local full-stack To-Do List Application

## Overview
This application will allow users to _view_, _add_, and _delete_ tasks from the list.

## Main goal
The primary goal of this project is to understand how the three main parts of a web application work together locally:
* the User Interface (Frontend), 
* the Server Logic (Backend API), and 
* the Database.

## Technology Stack
* **Frontend (UI):** React (a JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
* **Backend (API Server):** Node.js with the Express.js framework
* **Database:** SQLite (a lightweight, file-based relational database)
* **Tools:** VS Code, Git Bash terminal

## Features
* _**View Tasks:**_ Display all pending tasks in a clean list format.
* _**Add Tasks:**_ Input a new task description and add it to the list.
* _**Delete Tasks:**_ Remove completed or unwanted tasks.
